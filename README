TagLib packaged as an xcframework with SwiftPM wrappers

Targets / Products
- TagLib (binary): xcframework bundling TagLib built for macOS.
- TagLibBridge: Objective-C++ bridge exposing read/write over TagLib (MP3, MP4/M4A/M4B/M4V, FLAC, OGG, Opus, WavPack, MPC, DSF, WAV, AIFF). Matroska not supported by TagLib.
- MatroskaBridge: Placeholder for MKV/MKA/WebM. Real implementation requires linking libmatroska + libebml (or FFmpeg). Currently returns “not supported” unless you add those deps and fill the TODO.
- TagLibReadWriteTests: Test harness for TagLibBridge read/write; fixtures can be placed under ~/Music/test (or set TAGLIB_TEST_FIXTURES). Add more sources if a format is missing.

Matroska note
TagLib does not support Matroska. If you need MKV/MKA/WebM, link libmatroska+libebml and implement MatroskaBridge (parsing VorbisComment-style tags and attachments). The target is present to keep the App-facing API stable; without the libs it returns “not supported”.

Fixtures note
Some sources (e.g. Freesound) require an API key. Put it in `scripts/.env` (see `scripts/.env.example`) or export `FREESOUND_API_KEY` before running `scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh`. The script manages a local venv and installs dependencies from `scripts/requirements.txt` (currently empty).
