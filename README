# TagLib

TagLib is a lightweight library for reading and writing audio file metadata.  
This repository provides an enhanced and easy-to-integrate version of the original TagLib, with additional improvements such as **Package Manager (PM) support**.

## 📌 What's New Compared to the Original TagLib

- **Added Package Manager Support (PM Support)**  
  This repository can be integrated directly through package managers (e.g., Swift Package Manager), avoiding manual builds or maintaining the original source code.

- **Simplified Project Structure & Wrapper**  
  Makes it easier to use TagLib in modern applications.

- **More Convenient Integration Options**  
  Supports SPM integration, manual source integration, and framework-based integration.

## 🎯 What This Library Can Do

This library allows you to:

- Read common metadata fields from audio files  
  (title, artist, album, year, cover art, etc.)
- Write or modify metadata tags
- Batch process metadata for large collections of audio files
- Build audio players, media organizers, auto-tagging tools, and more

Supported formats include (but are not limited to):

- **MP3** (ID3v1 / ID3v2)
- **FLAC / OGG** (Vorbis Comments)
- **M4A / MP4**
- **WAV / AIFF** (where supported by TagLib)
